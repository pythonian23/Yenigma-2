 ## How it's different from the Enigma
  - A character can output any character when encrypted, and doesn't exclude itself.
  - Inputs that go through the plugboard change the rotation.
    - This makes sure the plugboard cannot be ignored.
    - This also lets two identical characters inputted in a row can be encrypted as a two of the same characters in a row or two different characters.
